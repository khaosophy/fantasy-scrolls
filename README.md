# Tabletop Tools

This application will contain a number of useful tabletop tools for games like D&D. It is in its infancy right now, but will grow over time. For more details about the current and upcoming tools, see below.

## Handouts

Ever want to quickly make up a handout to distribute to your players, like a message from a goblin holding a friend ransom, or a noble person offering a reward for slaying a monster? You can do so with our handout tool! Select the font, font size, and write up the message. You can then download the image to print or to upload to your favorite virtual tabletop.

## Dice Roller and Analyzer (Coming Soon)

This future feature will let you roll dice in the app and determine what the average roll will be with the given configuration. You will also be able to easily compare configurations (like 2d8 vs 4d4). This will be useful for analyzing and comparing different spells or attacks.

## Treasure Generator (Coming Soon)

This future feature will automatically generate treasure (either hoard treasure or individual treasure) based on the tables in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

## Spell Scroll Creator (Coming Soon)

Are you sick of adventures rewarding "a first level spell scroll," but leave it to you to pick the spell? This future feature will make it easy to pick a spell at random for your party. It will allow filtering by the following:

* Class
* Spell Level
* Spell School
